Name: gold
URL: http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/
Version: 2.21.1

Description:
This directory contains a binary of the gold linker from GNU binutils.
It was built from binutils-2.21.1 on 64-bit Ubuntu Lucid with configure as:
  ./configure --enable-gold=default --enable-threads

(ld.bfd is a forwarding script that is in place because the NaCl build
depends on there being a script with that name in the same directory as
ld.)
